.SH NAME
bibleplan \- Follow a Bible-reading plan with kjv(1).

.SH USAGE
.PP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B bibleplan 
allows you to follow a Bible-reading plan with
.B kjv(1),
right in your terminal!
.PP
The reading plan is a plain text file, located by default at
/usr/local/share/bibleplan/plan.txt.
Each day of assigned reading is represented by a line beginning with
a date in DDMMM format (e.g. 06JAN), followed by Bible passages delimited
by semicolons.
.B bibleplan
parses this text file, finds the line containing the current day's reading,
extracts the relevant passages, and sends them one at a time to
.B kjv(1).

.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.B bibleplan [date]
If assigned reading exists for [date], open it in kjv(1). If [date] is not
given, uses the current date. Dates must be written in DDMMM format, but
padding with zeros is not required. For example: 01JAN, 01jan, 1JAN, 1jan
are all valid dates.

.TP
.B bibleplan -l, --list [date]
Show the assigned reading for [date] instead of sending the passages to
.B kjv(1).
If [date] is not given, uses the current date.

.TP
.B bibleplan -f, --file
Show the plan file that
.B bibleplan
is using. This file can be changed by editing the filedetails() function.

.TP
.B bibleplan -e, --edit

/usr/local/share/bibleplan/plan.txt.

.TP
.B bibleplan -m, --make [year]

located by default at

and emits it to stdout. To write the new plan to a file, you could
do something like:
.br
$ bibleplan --make 2021 > 2021.txt
